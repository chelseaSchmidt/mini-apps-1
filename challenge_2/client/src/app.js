//The client app should be able to submit JSON data to the server, receive a
//response containing a CSV-formatted result (the way this is done will vary
//depending on where you are in the challenge).

//Implement all the report generation logic on the server. Do not use any
//external libraries (such as via npm). You may use jQuery on the client.

//Initially, submission of the JSON data (from the client to server) should be
//done using an HTML form with a single textarea input field (for the entire
//JSON text) and a submit button. When the user clicks submit, POST the form data
//to the server. The form submission process should use the default browser
//action/behavior. DO NOT use jQuery/AJAX functions in the submission process.
