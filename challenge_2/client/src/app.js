//refactor to a single page application by using jQuery/AJAX to submit your
//JSON file to the server using AJAX. Note: a single page app means that once
//the page loads, no user-generated actions on the page may cause the entire
//page to reload. You will know the page is reloading if you see a change in
//your URL. You must prevent this behavior from occurring.

//Lastly, add a link to download the most recently created CSV report. You can
//choose to make this a server-based or client-based action.

//You are allowed to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM and handle any DOM events.
//You may use jQuery/Ajax only when you get to the step in the basic requirements
//that asks you to do so. For ease of development, be sure to use nodemon to watch
//for changes in your project. Additionally, no CSS styling is necessary. Use the
//browser's default styling for all elements on your page.

//Use the coding best practices you learned previously to ensure a clear separation
//of concerns with well-defined interfaces.
